  introduction: 'Working on a team project or tracking JSON version changes? Our JSON Diff tool helps you quickly compare two JSON files and visualize differences. We highlight added keys, deleted entries, and modified values in a clear, color-coded view, so you can spot changes at a glance.\nUse cases include:\nReviewing pull requests with JSON configs\nTracking data version history in databases\nDebugging mismatches between API responses\nNo more scrolling through lines of code—our tool automatically parses nested objects and arrays, making complex comparisons simple. Paste or upload two JSON files, and let our json compare feature show you exactly what\'s changed. Ideal for developers, QA teams, and data managers!',
